Create a class `ATM` with a default constructor and the following member variables:
- a variable that holds the number of $100 notes
- a variable that holds the number of $50 notes
- a variable that holds the number of $20 notes
- a variable that holds the number of $10 notes
- a variable that holds the number of $5 notes 

What data type is best suitable to represent the number of each individual denomination?
