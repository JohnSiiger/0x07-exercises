## 0x00 - Triangle

Create the files must be named `triangle.h` and `triangle.cpp` in the directory where `main.cpp` is located (be sure the paths are correct).

Implement a class `Triangle` with the following:

- Data members `a`, `b` and `c` each representing a side of the triangle. Should the sides be of type `int` or `float`?
- Member functions
  - `Triangle()`
  - `void setSides(double a, double b, double c)`
  - `double circumference()`
  - `double print()`
  - Getters and setters for each data member (six functions in total)


Test the function by running the program provided in `main.cpp`
